The previous AI engineer initiated building an automated supermarket purchase system, pivoting twice based on encountered blockers. Initially, a web scraping approach for  and  was attempted but failed due to sophisticated anti-bot protections. This led to a critical architectural pivot towards Android app automation using Appium, addressing the core challenge of data acquisition. A subsequent realization of the cloud container's inability to connect to the user's local physical device prompted another pivot to a local system installation. The work has since focused on guiding the user through setting up the full-stack application (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB, Appium) on their Windows PC, largely addressing various environmental and dependency errors. The most recent issue,  failing to launch mobile app activities, was traced to incorrect package names. The AI engineer has just provided the corrected  file, aiming to resolve this last significant hurdle for functional mobile automation.

The objective is to build a system that automates regular supermarket purchases from  and . The core problem is the tedious manual process of finding products and comparing prices across these two stores, especially considering varying prices, sizes (e.g., price per liter), and promotions (e.g., 2x1 deals). The system needs to find a list of products from a Google Sheet (later changed to a CSV file upload due to Google API issues), compare prices across both supermarkets, and add the cheaper/more convenient option to a virtual cart. The final output should be two carts ready for payment, not automatically completing the purchase. A key consideration is intelligent comparison: normalizing prices by unit (e.g., price per liter) and accounting for promotions. The current implementation includes a React frontend for CSV upload and product search, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB for data storage. The initial web scraping attempt failed, leading to a pivot to Android app automation for price collection.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS (for UI), CRACO (for Tailwind config), Shadcn UI components.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python web framework), MongoDB (database), Appium (mobile automation), Python  and  libraries.
- **Tools/Utilities**: ADB (Android Debug Bridge), Node.js/npm/yarn (for frontend dependencies), Python pip (for backend dependencies), Git/GitHub (for code management).
- **Core Logic**: Price comparison algorithms, unit price normalization, promotion handling.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack architecture:


-   ****: This is the core FastAPI backend. It handles API endpoints for CSV upload () and product search (). It integrates the  to perform actual product searches on the mobile apps. It also defines data models and handles CORS.
-   ****: This file contains the logic for automating Android apps using Appium. It includes , , ,  for specific store searches, and helper functions like  and  to parse search results. It was recently updated with the correct package names ( for Jumbo and  for Lider).
-   ****: The main React component that forms the user interface. It manages state for file uploads, product lists, and search results. It interacts with the backend API (, ) to send product queries and display responses. It was recently updated with inline styles for a visually appealing UI when Tailwind config issues arose.
-   ** and **: These files define the styling for the React application.  imports Tailwind directives and global styles, while  contains custom styles and animations, contributing to the beautiful UI requirement.
-   ** and **: These are configuration files for Tailwind CSS and PostCSS, enabling the use of Tailwind classes in the frontend for modern styling. They were created/verified during the local setup troubleshooting.
-   ** files**: Provide templates for environment variables (, , ), crucial for service communication and configuration without hardcoding.
-   **Windows Batch Files (, )**: These scripts were created to simplify the local installation and startup process for the user on a Windows machine, bundling multiple command-line operations.

<pending_tasks>
- Full mobile app automation for product search, price extraction, and adding to cart remains to be fully functional.
- The  still needs to effectively extract product details (name, price, size) from the app UI, handle login flows, and add items to the cart.
- Integration of the scraped data into the intelligent comparison logic for size normalization and promotion handling needs to be robustly tested with real app data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging the Android app automation component of the system. The user reported that searching for Coca Cola in the frontend did not trigger any action on their physical Android phone. After troubleshooting, it was discovered that while Appium was connecting to the device (evidenced by the Appium Settings app briefly opening), it failed to launch the correct target applications (Jumbo and Lider). The root cause was that the  file was using incorrect placeholder package names for the Jumbo and Lider apps.

The user then provided the *correct* package names ( for Jumbo and  for Lider). The AI engineer's last action was to provide the complete, updated  file, incorporating these accurate package names into the  and / functions, along with robust XPath selectors and improved error handling for product extraction. The current state is that the user needs to replace their  file with the provided updated code and then restart the backend to test the full mobile automation flow.

<optional_next_step>
Instruct the user to replace the  file, restart the backend, and then attempt a product search via the frontend.
