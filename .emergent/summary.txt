The previous AI engineer embarked on building an automated supermarket purchasing system, facing significant technical hurdles that led to two major architectural pivots. Initially, web scraping (, ) was attempted but abandoned due to anti-bot measures, leading to a shift to Android app automation via Appium. A subsequent realization that the cloud environment couldn't interact with the user's local physical device prompted the final pivot to a local system installation.

The core of the recent work has been debugging and stabilizing the local Appium-based mobile automation. This involved addressing persistent issues:
1.  **Appium Connection**: Ensuring the Appium server was running and the Python backend could connect to it (port ).
2.  **App Launch**: Guaranteeing that the target Android applications (Jumbo and Lider) correctly launched on the user's physical device using the right package names (, ) and activities.
3.  **Element Interaction**: Overcoming  and  during search bar interaction (clicking, clearing, typing). This involved implementing retry logic and re-finding elements.
4.  **Code Structure**: Correcting critical Python indentation errors that caused s, preventing class methods from being recognized.
5.  **Search Submission**: Ensuring the typed product name actually triggered a search within the app and navigated to results.

The current state, as per the latest logs, indicates that apps are launching, and search bars are being interacted with, but there are still unresolved issues in search submission (Jumbo returns to home) and initial search element finding (Lider).

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to automate regular supermarket purchases from  and . The system aims to alleviate the manual effort of price comparison, especially considering variations in price, size (e.g., price per liter), and promotions (e.g., 2x1 deals). The system needs to:
- Accept a list of products (initially Google Sheet, now CSV file upload due to API issues).
- Compare prices for these products across Jumbo and Lider supermarkets.
- Identify the cheaper or more convenient option based on intelligent comparison (normalizing by unit, accounting for promotions).
- Generate two virtual carts, one for each store, ready for manual payment completion (no automated purchase).

The current application implements:
- A React frontend for CSV file uploads and initiating product searches.
- A FastAPI backend for processing requests and interacting with the mobile automation layer.
- MongoDB for data storage (e.g., product lists).
- An Android app automation component (using Appium) to collect real-time pricing data from the Jumbo and Lider mobile applications, pivoting from an initial failed web scraping attempt.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, CRACO, Shadcn UI.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (database), Appium (mobile automation), , .
- **Tools**: ADB (Android Debug Bridge), Node.js/npm/yarn, Python pip.
- **Core Logic**: Price comparison, unit price normalization, promotion handling (partially implemented/pending).

<code_architecture>


-   ****: This is the core FastAPI backend. It handles API endpoints for CSV upload () and product search (). It was initially configured for web scraping but has been explicitly switched to use the  for product searches. It integrates the  to perform actual product searches on the mobile apps, defines data models, and handles CORS.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The most significant change was switching its underlying scraping logic from web (Playwright) to mobile (Appium) by replacing its content with the version that imports  and calls its methods (, ).
-   ****: This file contains the logic for automating Android apps using Appium. It includes functions for setting up () and closing () the Appium driver, and app-specific search functions (, ). It also has helper functions for handling app permissions, login flows, and extracting product data ().
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file underwent multiple iterative changes:
        1.  Initial package names were corrected to  for Jumbo and  for Lider.
        2.  The  method was enhanced to explicitly activate the app after driver initialization and try alternative launch methods (, ).
        3.  Search interaction methods (, ) were improved to combat  by re-finding elements before each interaction, adding retry logic, and incorporating multiple input/submission strategies (e.g., , , , character-by-character typing).
        4.  Critical Python indentation errors for , , , , and  were identified and fixed, ensuring these methods are properly part of the  class.
        5.  Initial implementations for  and  were added with various selectors and fallback mechanisms for parsing product names and prices from the app UI.
-   ****: The main React component that forms the user interface, managing state for file uploads, product lists, and search results. It interacts with the backend API.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Was noted to have inline styles for UI, indicating some previous styling adjustments.
-   ** files**: Provide templates for environment variables (, , ), crucial for service communication and configuration without hardcoding.
-   **Windows Batch Files (, )**: These scripts were created to simplify the local installation and startup process for the user on a Windows machine.

<pending_tasks>
- Full mobile app automation for product search, price extraction, and adding to cart remains to be fully functional, especially:
    - Jumbo: The search completes but returns to home, and product extraction is failing to find any items.
    - Lider: Still struggling to correctly find the search element and successfully input text.
- Integration of the scraped data into the intelligent comparison logic for size normalization and promotion handling needs to be robustly tested with real app data.
- MongoDB installation and successful connection on the user's local machine.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging persistent issues in the Android app automation component, specifically after the user reported that the apps launched, but the search functionality was not working as expected.

The most recent log (Chat 112) indicates:
-   **Jumbo app**: Successfully launches (). It finds a search element (), clicks it, clears the field, types Coca cola, and presses enter. The log shows ‚úÖ Jumbo search submitted successfully. However, despite this, the app goes back to home instead of sending the search value, and the subsequent product extraction step reports ‚ùå No product elements found and üîç Found 0 elements with $ symbol, resulting in 0 products extracted. There was a  during the first search attempt, but the retry logic handled it, allowing the text to be typed.
-   **Lider app**: Successfully launches (). However, it then reports ‚ùå Could not find search element in Lider app and ‚ùå Lider search failed. This means the current set of selectors and interaction methods for the Lider search bar are still not robust enough to reliably locate or interact with the element.

The AI engineer's last action was to acknowledge these specific failures and state the intention to create a more robust solution that handles the actual UI elements in these apps, indicating a plan to refine the element targeting and interaction logic further for both stores.

Enhance element targeting and interaction logic in  to correctly perform search and extract products in both Jumbo and Lider apps.
