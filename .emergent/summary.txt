The previous AI engineer's work centered on stabilizing and enhancing the mobile automation component () of an automated supermarket purchasing system for Jumbo and Lider apps, a pivot from failed web scraping. The primary challenges involved debugging Appium driver sessions, robust element targeting, and accurate product data extraction, including prices, names, and promotions. Initial attempts to unify extraction logic led to  and unintended app launches (Petal Search). A series of conservative fixes targeted Jumbo's extraction for names and promotions, while also addressing frontend UI component loading and general styling issues. The trajectory shows an iterative process of bug fixing, with the engineer adapting to specific user reports, finally providing a comprehensive  update to address Appium stability, correct app launching, and refine extraction logic for both stores, aiming for accurate promotion and product name recognition.

The application aims to automate supermarket purchases by comparing product prices from Jumbo and Lider, and generating virtual shopping carts. The core problem addressed is the manual effort involved in comparing varying prices, unit sizes, and promotions across stores. The system needs to accept product lists (CSV input), perform real-time price comparisons via mobile app scraping (Appium), intelligently identify the best deals, and output optimized virtual carts.

The current implementation features a React frontend for user interaction (CSV upload, product search), a FastAPI backend for request processing and orchestrating mobile automation, and MongoDB for storing product lists. The mobile automation layer, using Appium, is crucial for scraping live data from Android apps, a necessity due to previous anti-bot measures encountered with web scraping. Recent development efforts have focused intensively on debugging and refining this mobile automation to ensure accurate data extraction, especially addressing issues with product name recognition, promotional pricing, and Appium stability.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, CRACO.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB, Appium (), , , .
-   **Mobile Automation**: Android Debug Bridge (ADB), XPath, resource-id, content-desc for element interaction.
-   **Data Processing**: Price parsing (Chilean currency, promotions), Y-coordinate proximity grouping for element association, unit price normalization, and Excel export.

<code_architecture>


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI backend, handles API endpoints for CSV upload (), product search (, ), and now Excel export (). It integrates with  and MongoDB.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  endpoint which leverages  and  to generate Excel reports from search results.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains all Appium automation logic for interacting with Jumbo and Lider Android applications. It's responsible for driver setup, app launching, element searching, text input, and most critically, product data extraction and parsing. This file has undergone the most significant iterative changes.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Driver Session Management**:  now robustly quits existing drivers to prevent context mixing and attempts to activate the correct app package.
        -   **Robust Search**:  and  were heavily refined to use ultra-robust strategies: re-finding elements for each interaction (to avoid ), multiple XPath patterns, and various submission methods (Enter key, search buttons).
        -   **Jumbo Extraction**:  was revamped multiple times. The latest version implements tighter Y-coordinate proximity grouping (150px), specific filtering for payment-related prices (e.g., Lleva 2 a ), improved product name detection () with Jumbo-specific keywords, and refined promotion parsing () to correctly interpret Lleva X por  as a total price. Duplicate product prevention was also added.
        -   **Lider Extraction**:  now incorporates the corrected logic (formerly ), including Y-coordinate proximity grouping (200px), and uses general  and  methods.
        -   **Utility Methods**:  was adjusted for Windows path compatibility (saving to current directory instead of ).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component forming the user interface. It handles CSV file uploads, initiates product searches, displays results, and now triggers Excel exports.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  function to call the backend's Excel export endpoint and dynamically added Export to Excel buttons for both single product search results and full search results. It also includes enhanced error handling and displays the backend URL for debugging.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: New directory and files (, , , ) created to provide basic, styled UI components, addressing module not found errors and restoring proper Tailwind CSS styling.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages frontend dependencies and scripts.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to ensure all necessary dependencies (including , , , ) are present, and a  entry was added to simplify API requests during development.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines environment variables for the frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Ensured  is correctly set.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  for Excel generation capabilities.
-   **, , , **:
    -   **Importance**: Configuration and main styling files for Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes Made**: Ensured correct configuration and imports to enable Tailwind CSS styling, fixing the format is gone issue.

<pending_tasks>
- Robustly test the current state of mobile app automation for product search and price extraction in Jumbo to confirm name and promotion recognition are fully functional.
- Validate that the Petal Search and app launching issues are completely resolved for both Jumbo and Lider.
- Test the end-to-end flow with the newly added Excel export functionality for both single and multiple product searches.
- Confirm MongoDB installation and successful connection (mentioned generally, but not directly addressed in trajectory).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was fully focused on resolving critical bugs in the mobile app automation (), as reported by the user.

The key issues being addressed were:
1.  **Appium Stability and Stale Elements**: Users reported  and applications (Jumbo, Lider) failing to launch or returning to the home screen after search attempts, specifically  launching instead of Jumbo or Lider failing to start ( never started).
2.  **Jumbo Extraction Inaccuracy**: Jumbo was still failing to recognize product names (showing Unknown Product X) and promotions (e.g., Lleva 2 por .090 was not parsed correctly), despite previous attempts to fix it.
3.  **Lider Method Mismatch**: An issue was identified where  was incorrectly calling  which was no longer properly defined or existing, leading to Lider search failures.

To address these, the AI engineer provided a comprehensive update to  (Chat Message 106) including:
-   **Ultra-Robust Search Methods**:  and  were implemented to aggressively re-find elements, use atomic operations (click-clear-type-submit in rapid succession), and employ multiple XPath patterns and submission methods to overcome stale element errors and navigation issues.
-   **Enhanced Navigation Validation**:  was introduced to intelligently determine if the app successfully navigated to search results or returned to the home page.
-   **Consolidated Lider Extraction**: The  method was integrated into  to standardize the naming and ensure the corrected logic is applied.
-   **Refined Jumbo Extraction**:  was updated with explicit filtering for payment-method specific prices, tighter Y-coordinate proximity grouping (150px), and sophisticated product name/size extraction () and promotion parsing () specifically tuned for Jumbo's UI.

Additionally, the AI engineer recently integrated **Excel export functionality** into the backend () and frontend (), which passed backend tests. Frontend UI issues (missing components, broken Tailwind CSS styling) were also addressed by providing the necessary component files and frontend configuration updates.
